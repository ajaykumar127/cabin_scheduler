Scheduler
=========

A simple little Sinatra app for the Prince Lab to help
schedule the mass spectrometer. It is pretty ghetto, but
it is good enough for what it will be used for.


Installation Instructions
=========================

Developed on Mac OS X using Ruby 1.9.2, Sinatra 1.1.0, and RSpec 2.2.0.

Grab it from Github, and install the dependencies:

$ git clone git://github.com/jergason/scheduler.git
$ cd scheduler
$ bundle install


You should be good to go. You can test it out by running

$ ruby app.rb

and then visiting http://localhost:4567 in your browser.


The configurations are currently just stored in the app.rb file, so edith them to
match your system. They should work by default, except for the email address.
